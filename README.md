## Image viewers


https://openseadragon.github.io/  

An open-source, web-based viewer for high-resolution zoomable images,implemented in pure JavaScript, for desktop and mobile.


http://iipimage.sourceforge.net/ 

IIPImage is an advanced high-performance feature-rich image server system for web-based streamed viewing and zooming of ultra high-resolution images. It is designed to be fast and bandwidth-efficient with low processor and memory requirements. The system can comfortably handle gigapixel size images as well as advanced image features such as 8, 16 and 32 bits per channel, CIELAB colorimetric images and scientific imagery such as multispectral images and digital elevation maps.

The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) is a consortium which collectively develops and maintains a standard for the representation of texts in digital form. Its chief deliverable is a set of Guidelines which specify encoding methods for machine-readable texts, chiefly in the humanities, social sciences and linguistics. Since 1994, the TEI Guidelines have been widely used by libraries, museums, publishers, and individual scholars to present texts for online research, teaching, and preservation.

http://iiif.io/model/shared-canvas/1.0/index.html

The SharedCanvas data model specifies a linked data based approach for describing digital facsimiles of physical objects in a collaborative fashion. It is intended for use in the cultural heritage domain, although may be useful in other areas, and is designed around requirements derived from digitized text-bearing objects such as medieval manuscripts. Instances of the data model are consumed by rendering platforms in order to understand the relationships between the constituent text, image, audio or other resources. These resources are associated with an abstract Canvas, or parts thereof, via Open Annotations and the Annotations are grouped and ordered in OAI-ORE Aggregations.


http://iiif.io/

The International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) is a set of shared application programming interface (API) specifications for interoperable functionality in digital image repositories. The IIIF is comprised of and driven by a community of libraries, museums, archives, software companies, and other organizations working together to create, test, refine, implement and promote the IIIF specifications. Using JSON-LD, linked data, and standard W3C web protocols such as Web Annotation, IIIF makes it easy to parse and share digital image data, migrate across technology systems, and provide enhanced image access for scholars and researchers. In short, IIIF enables better, faster and cheaper image delivery. It lets you leverage interoperability and the fabric of the Web to access new possibilities and new users for your image-based resources, while reducing long term maintenance and technological lock in. IIIF gives users a rich set of baseline functionality for viewing, zooming, and assembling the best mix of resources and tools to view, compare, manipulate and work with images on the Web, an experience made portableâ€“shareable, citable, and embeddable.
